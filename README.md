College Library Database
--------------------------

This project is a college library database designed and implemented for a Database Systems course.
The system is intended to manage library resources and member information, tracking loans, fines, and reservations.

Overview
---------------------

The database was developed using Oracle SQL, with a focus on database schema design, query optimization, 
and execution. It includes various features for managing library resources, such as books, CDs, DVDs, and videos, and enables members to borrow, renew, and return items while managing fines and overdue resources.

---------------------

Technologies Used:

Database: Oracle SQL / MYSQL

SQL Operations: Joins, Subqueries, Views

-------------------------------------
Conclusion
-----------------------

This project gave me the opportunity to design and implement a fully functional college library database. While the project was a collaborative effort, 
I focused primarily on developing all SQL operations. For the course, I used Oracle SQL as required, handling the schema, queries, and views. In addition to the course requirements, 
I took the initiative to extend the project by implementing MySQL on my own time and adding new queries that werenâ€™t originally included.
